        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Artificial Intelligence with Computer Science (year in industry) Student at the University of Birmingham, graduating in 2023. Outside of my studies I do rock climbing, jiu jitsu and I am the programming lead for the Brum Eco Racing society, UoB's team for the <a href="https://www.shell.com/make-the-future/shell-ecomarathon.html">Shell Eco Marathon</a> - 'One of the worldâ€™s leading energy efficiency competitions'. I also enjoy cycling and travelling!</p>

        <p>I am currently interested in Artificial Intelligence as a potential career path as this is the field I find most exciting, however, I'm sure I will come across new areas of computer science that will spark my interest too.</p>
